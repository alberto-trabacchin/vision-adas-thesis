    abstract = { We present a novel dataset captured from a VW station wagon for use in mobile robotics and autonomous driving research. In total, we recorded 6 hours of traffic scenarios at 10–100 Hz using a variety of sensor modalities such as high-resolution color and grayscale stereo cameras, a Velodyne 3D laser scanner and a high-precision GPS/IMU inertial navigation system. The scenarios are diverse, capturing real-world traffic situations, and range from freeways over rural areas to inner-city scenes with many static and dynamic objects. Our data is calibrated, synchronized and timestamped, and we provide the rectified and raw image sequences. Our dataset also contains object labels in the form of 3D tracklets, and we provide online benchmarks for stereo, optical flow, object detection and other tasks. This paper describes our recording platform, the data format and the utilities that we provide. }

title = {Serial order: a parallel distributed processing approach. Technical report, June 1985-March 1986},
author = {Jordan, M I},
abstractNote = {A theory of serial order is proposed that attempts to deal both with the classical problem of the temporal organization of internally generated action sequences as well as with certain of the parallel aspects of sequential behavior. The theory describes a dynamical system that is embodied as a parallel distributed processing or connectionist network. The trajectories of this dynamical system come to follow desired paths corresponding to particular action sequences as a result of a learning process during which constraints are imposed on the system. These constraints enforce sequentiality where necessary and, as they are relaxed, performance becomes more parallel. The theory is applied to the problem of coarticulation in speech production and simulation experiments are presented.},

    abstract = "{Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.}",

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents an object detector with depth estimation using monocular camera images. Previous detection studies have typically focused on detecting objects with 2D or 3D bounding boxes. A 3D bounding box consists of the center point, its size parameters, and heading information. However, predicting complex output compositions leads a model to have generally low performances, and it is not necessary for risk assessment for autonomous driving. We focused on predicting a single depth per object, which is essential for risk assessment for autonomous driving. Our network architecture is based on YOLO v4, which is a fast and accurate one-stage object detector. We added an additional channel to the output layer for depth estimation. To train depth prediction, we extract the closest depth from the 3D bounding box coordinates of ground truth labels in the dataset. Our model is compared with the latest studies on 3D object detection using the KITTI object detection benchmark. As a result, we show that our model achieves higher detection performance and detection speed than existing models with comparable depth accuracy.},
