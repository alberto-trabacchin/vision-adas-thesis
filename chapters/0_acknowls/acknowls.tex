I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to conduct my research in the laboratory 
of Professor Yasutaka Fujimoto as part of a double-degree program. This experience 
has been profoundly enriching both personally and professionally. I would like 
to express my heartfelt thanks to the Professor for welcoming me into his laboratory and 
giving me the chance to meet and work with inspirational individuals, including 
Flavis, Besong, Martin, and Brice. Our spontaneous conversations about research 
and our futures were both enjoyable and enlightening.

Morning coffee talks with Eriko Hino were a wonderful way to start each day with 
her positive humor. I also appreciate the effort she puts in as the secretary of 
the laboratory.

My gratitude extends to Professor Roberto Oboe for coordinating this experience 
abroad and connecting me with the laboratory.

Inoue and Ushiyama supported me to navigate a culture so different 
from my own. Their assistance made my transition much smoother.

I am profoundly grateful to Professor Monica Reggiani and her group, including 
Professor Stefano Michieletto, for their technical and moral support during 
challenging times in my research.

Special thanks to Elaine, Prateek, and Hassan from Magna International for their 
support from the company side during my thesis.

I am profoundly thankful to my family and my girlfriend, Giulia, who played a 
key role in this journey. Their strong support from day one has been indispensable.

Weekends spent having insightful talks with Marco on our shared interests were 
incredibly motivating. Also your support during difficult times helped me stay 
focused on my goals.

Lastly, but not least, I thank all the other new friends I made in Japan. Your 
presence and support have made this experience unforgettable.
